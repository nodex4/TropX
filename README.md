<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project
<div align="center">
  <img src="images/image.png" alt="image">
</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TropX is a command line application to run penetration testing scripts. It aims to more efficiently run long processes and tedious tasks by allowing the creation of custom scripts in the CLI that can be run whenever. To make scripting even easier, there are premade functions and variables for bash and python to be used to simplify the process. TropX also allows for maximum customization and optimization by providing a settings menu controlled trough the CLI. This project is free and opensource so all funding originates from <a href="#donate">donations</a>.

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>


<!-- Custom Scripts -->
# Custom Scripts

You can very easily add **Custom Scripts** to TropX to further personalize the CLI, it supports both **bash** and **python**. Additionally you can **clone** a tool from **github** also.


## **Bash**

TropX has some default **functions** and **variables** to simplify the programming pillar of custom scripts.


* ### **Custom Files**
* Create custom files for your tool to use
  * To add custom files into your tools file tree navigate into the TropX folder and go to the `custom_scripts` folder, in here you can find your tool's folder and add any file youw ant to.
  * To acces these files within the file tree you will have to prefix them with the following directory `$folder` for it to look like such:
    ```
    "$folder/wordlist.txt"
    ```
    * It is neccesarry to wrap it in double qoutes
    * replace `worldist.txt` with the file you wish to access
    * `$folder` is a built in variable that holds the folder of the current script

---


* ### **installPackages**
* Install Packages more simply and reliably without causing errors and messing up the script
  ```sh
  installPackages "python3" "network-manager" "macchanger" 
  ```
  * All packages listed after the `installPackages` command will be installed automatically.
  * If they already are installed nothing will happen.
  * The function accepts an infinite amount of packages.

---
* ### **selectOptions**

* With `selectOptions` you can ask the user to select an option, the CLI equivalent of good navigation.


  ```sh
  selectOptions "Options" "Select Desired Option" "Select a Valid Option" "Option1" "Option2" "Option3"
  ```
  *  `"Options"` is the title for the option choices
  *  `"Enter selection Here" "Try another selection"` These two are the `type here` text before the `>`, the second will be shown in case of an error.
  *  `"Option1" "Option2" "Option3"` The rest are options which will be shown to the user, they can be passed singularly or in an Array 
  * The ouput can be saved into a variable like so, where `choice` is the number corresponding to the option, so if you choose `Option2`, then `$SO` and also `choice` will be set to `2`. This extra step is recommended as sometimes the variable gets overwritten by this function getting run somewhere else and then its value will change to something completely diffrent and irrelevant.
    ```sh
    choice=$SO
    ```
  * The function has a built-in check for the selected option to confirm it's validity.

---

* ### **getInput**
* With `getInput` you can get user input to save into a variable and use within your custom script

  ```sh
  getInput "File Name" "Type a file name" "file.txt"
  ```
  * `"File Name"` is the title for the get input function
  * `"Type a file name"` is going to be the action they are to perform or write
  * `"file.txt"` is an example of what their input should look like
    ```sh
    input=$SI
    ```
  
  *  The ouput can be saved into a variable like so, where input is the text inputted, so if you typed in `foo`, then `$SI` and also `input` will be set to `foo`. This extra step is recommended as sometimes the variable gets overwritten by this function getting run somewhere else and then its value will change to something completely diffrent and irrelevant.
  * In the below example im using getInput to obtain a valid path to a file
  * To ensure that your user returns a proper and useful string, you can run it trough an until loop
    ```sh
        getInput "File Path" "Please type in the relative or full path of the script" "Do not incldue a file extension" "file.txt"
    path=$SI

      until [ -f $path ] #this is a bash built-in way to check if a file exists
      do
        getInput error "File Path" "Please type in the relative or full path of the script" "Do not incldue a file extension" "file.txt"
        path=$SI
      done
    ```
  * First I just `getInput` normally from the user
  * Here I run an `until` loop which checks if the path exists, if it does nothing happens, otherwise it will loop until the expression is true.
  * Make sure to pass `error` as the first argument in the getInput function and keep the rest as is
    
---

* #### **message**
* With the `message` function you can display a message to the user that waits until they press a key on their keyboard.

  ```sh
  Message="TropX is cool!"
  message "Disclaimer" "$Message"
  ```
  *  `"Disclaimer"` is the title for the message
  *  `"$Message"` is the variable in which the message is stored
    


---

* #### **attackPending**
* With the `attackPending` function you inform the user with a message that the script/tool is in progress.

  ```sh
  attackPending
  ```


---

* #### **changeWImode**
* With the `changeWImode` function, you can easily change the mode of your Wireless Interface
  ```sh
  changeWImode monitor
  # ...
  changeWImode managed
  ```
  * The only argument passed will be the mode you want to change the Wireless Interface to
  * The Wireless Interface used will be the one the user has saved in the settings page
    
---

* #### **changeMac**
* With the `changeMac` function, you can easily change your Mac Address to either a random or specific one
  ```sh
  changeMac 
  # ...
  changeMac "00:d0:70:00:20:69"
  # ...
  changeMac reset
  ```
  * If no argument is passed, a random Mac Address will be choosen to replace your current
  * Optionally, you can specify what you want your Mac Address to be
  * `reset` will set your Wireless Interface back to it's default permanent Mac Address
  * The Wireless Interface used will be the one the user has saved in the settings
---

* #### **changeIP**
* With the `changeIP` function, you can easily manage your IP Address
  ```sh
  changeIP
  # ...
  changeIP "132.52.98.1629"
  # ...
  changeIP reset
  ```
  * If no argument is passed, a random IP Address will be choosen to replace your current
  * Optionally, you can specify what you want your IP Address to be
  * `reset` will set the IP back to its default
  * The Wireless Interface used will be the one the user has saved in the settings
---

* #### **$WI**
* The `WI` variable holds the name of the Wireless Interface (e.g. `wlan0`)
* This is obtained from the user's settings and changed in the settings page also

---

* #### **$DI**
* The `DI` variable holds the name of the Default Interface (e.g. `eth0`), this is to be used when setting localports, etc
* This is obtained from the user's settings and changed in the settings page also

---

* #### **$IP**
* The `IP` variable holds the ip of the primary Wireless Interface
* This is obtained automatically

---

* #### **$PRIMARY & $SECONDARY**
* The `$PRIMARY` variable holds the color code for the primary (*no shit*) color
* The `$SECONDARY` variable holds the color code for the secondary (*no shit again*) color
* Make sure to escape it like such
  ```sh
  echo -e "${PRIMARY}Hello ${SECONDARY}World!"
  ```
* Even though it is not neccesary to use these variables, it is highly recommended so your script stays in sync with the user's settings

---
### **python**
Sadly this language does not have any premade functions or variables **yet**!

---
